# 🖱️ Python Click Counter App (Tkinter GUI)

A **GUI-based Python program** that simulates a simple **Click Counter Application**.
This project allows users to increment, reset, and track the total number of clicks using a graphical interface built with **Tkinter**.

---

## 💡 Features

* **Click Counter System** — users can click a button to increase the count
* **Reset Function** — quickly reset the counter back to zero
* **Undo / Decrease (optional)** — revert the last click (if added)
* **Simple GUI Layout** — includes buttons and labels for easy interaction
* **Real-time Update** — the counter updates instantly on every click

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program launches a **Tkinter window** with a counter label and buttons.
2. Clicking the “Click Me” button increments the counter.
3. The “Reset” button sets the counter back to **0**.
4. The label dynamically updates to show the current count.
